# **One Word** 

## <ins>***Brainstorming part 1</ins>:***
##### **Normal**/*normally* ***VS*** **usual**/*usually*
- Normal – out of the norm
- Normally I buy things but today I decide to go somewhere else.
- That not normal – person could use it both a as a derogatory term or as, or when their scared the other person is n doing ca be alarming to their health.
- This usage if word can show a person’s social background – in one social a certain behaviour can be seen as out of the norm in the other it might be alright.
- Before doing this assignment, as it had told us to do – in class I have heard that I was not the only one who thought of this certain word?
- And why is that?
- Connection to mental health

##### **Literally**
-	In a literal sense
- In modern slang its used in sentence when the speak does not actually mean it in a literal sense
- Confusing

##### **“like” & stuff** 
- my filler words

##### ***“Girl dinner”***
#
– rather than a single word a phrase and evolution of it – (an internet trend) (ps. My point of view)
– this phrase originated from a video where a person is eating an ice cream. 
– What ppl interpreted, found a common ground in is that sometimes a person wants to have any food juts in a sake of eating something.
– 	Witch kind of branch out to people showing how to make “girl dinner” meaning foods that you can make yourself or just a simple snack.
– Then it evolved into girl lunch and breakfast where again ppl shared their quick recipes. It also inspired people to make educational videos about eating disorders.
– In fandoms it took of meaning of attraction to a certain character 
– Then to make it inclusive for any one it evolved into boy dinner, nonbinary luck etc.

###### *Speaking of inclusion:*
#
– Then it took another spin: The phrase got niche – for fun and learning. 
-	Gay math. – mainly jokes about how the gay (umbrella term) people are just faster getting to place by foot
-	Neurodivergent, ADHD, autism math. – how a brain of   Neurodivergent versus neurotypical person works
-	And very interesting take: nonbinary linguistics (which I saw recently) – where a person teaches about vocabulary that is respectful and inclusive for LGBTQ+ folks.


# <ins>***Brainstorming part 2</ins>:***
 # **Normal** 
  ***1st half =  draft; 2nd half = more brainstorming***
 #
### *First Half*

Conforming to things that are expected in society, but if not things are not normal, they are out of that norm. In closed-minded communities of the word this a a huge problem you can be viewed as a sick/ill/ not healthy person and be cast out out to the corner. In creative industries things that are not normal can be viewed as thinking out of the box and those ideas are often praised. There for the usage of this word can show a person’s social background – in one society a certain behaviour can be seen as out of the norm in the other it might be alright It can show what values a certain person or family has.

*“ This ain't normal.”* - a phrase many of us probably heard - but was used in a derogatory tone / or in a caring way? weather way this phrase is used when something is alarming and is contented to health. 	When someone says this is not ok it means this is not healthy there is something wrong or broken and it needs to be fixed. It is not normal = there is something wrong

### *Second Half*

- Overgeneralisation and prejudice 
- normally as usually 
- norms and standards - unhealthy norms 
- “normalise”  
- “normal” - in an email - meaning behind it
- people are afraid of things that are not normal - it sacres them cause they don't understand it - the fear of the unknown, uncertain of things 
- “ get the world get back to normal” - normal =  calm and peaceful 
- *Normality* is usually seen as **good and desirable by society and what society** thinks while abnormality may be seen as bad or undesirable (Boundless).
- normal things are connected to behaviour and patterns in a daily routine 
- comfort zones - how comfortable you are stepping outside the normal

##   <ins>***Organizing my notes***</ins> 
Then after two brainstorming sessions I got lost. I had many brainstormed ideas still in chaotic notes.
So first I asked ChatGBT *`"i am about to give you a text, your job is to find the main 3 topics"`* The text was part two of the brainstorming. Here is what it gave me:

**`1. Conformity and Social Norms `**

**`2. Health and Well-being`**

**`3. Diversity and Uniqueness`**

My next step was to organise my notes (from my second brainstorming)  so I asked ChatGBT again:
*`"I am about to give you a text. Sort the text by following topics: 1. health, 2. social norms, 3. creativity and originality. Do not change any words of the text."`*

This is how it sorted out my notes:

**`Health:`**
- "When someone says this is not ok it means this is not healthy there is something wrong or broken and it needs to be fixed."
- "Overgeneralisation and prejudice."

**`Social Norms:`**
- "Conforming to things that are expected in society, but if not things are not normal, they are out of that norm."
- "In closed-minded communities of the word this is a huge problem you can be viewed as a sick/ill/ not healthy person and be cast out to the corner."
- "There for the usage of this word can show a person’s social background – in one society a certain behaviour can be seen as out of the norm in the other it might be alright. It can show what values a certain person or family has."
- "people are afraid of things that are not normal - it scares them cause they don't understand it - the fear of the unknown, uncertain of things."
- "normal things are connected to behavior and patterns in a daily routine."
- "normal things are expected in social events — great expectations!"

**`Creativity and Originality:`**
- "In creative industries things that are not normal can be viewed as thinking out of the box and those ideas are often praised."
- "i just want to be normal" - i just want to be like everybody else - but if everyone was normal and everyone would be the same - with no quietness in the world how would that look - VERY BORING AND MONOTONE - AND PREDICTABLE so predictable - normal things are predictable not normal things are not."

*(first draft)*
# **Normal**


Every time I hear the word *normal* (in any form)  I cringe. It's such a vague term. From person to person, *normal* could mean entirely different things.

Firstly this word is so overused by people who try to reprove others. The phrase *“ Behave normally”* to be exact. In my case, it is **normally** when, One: I am very expressive - I am too excited, I am too angry - I am overreacting or Two I don't express an emotion that is expected of me in a particular situation. In this case means a set of rules that are expected out of an individual in society, that are the norm.

What can be out of the norm? usually behaviour or someone else's health - in cases of physical health  “That is not normal to have a temperature that high. You are sick and need a  proper treatment. But it can be an issue when speaking in terms of mental health, cause in some communities some stuff might be frowned upon and treated as a sickness but in fact, it might be not (ex. homosociality).

This also comes to an interesting viewpoint: people are afraid of things that are out of the norm, it is unpredictable and people are scared of unknown things.

On the other hand, things that are not normal can *also* be praised  It masks itself as originality and creativity. It's something new and steps out of the norm.

That causes a question: How a world that is normal would look? Very boring and monotone!  Same kind of trees and the same kind of environment. Same everything. People would like identical copies of one another behaving in the same way as if they were robots destined to go in one and only path.
